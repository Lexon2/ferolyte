**Breaking:** `components.icon` now only references an `item_texture.json` key. The compiler no longer generates or merges `textures/item_texture.json` (it is copied as a normal resource pack file), and `resolveItemIcon`, `ItemBuilder.withPackConfig` and `ItemBuilder.getItemTextureEntries` were removed. A warning is logged when an icon value is a `textures/...` path.
